# TeamUp - New Landing Page

This directory contains the files for the static marketing landing page.

## How to View

1.  Navigate to this `new-landing-page` directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

    *Alternatively, you can use a simple HTTP server for better local testing (especially if dealing with certain asset types or AJAX in the future). For example, if you have Python installed, run:* `python -m http.server` *in this directory and then visit* `http://localhost:8000` *in your browser.*

## Contents

*   `index.html`: The main page structure.
*   `css/style.css`: Contains all the styling rules.
*   `js/script.js`: Handles interactive elements like scrolling, navigation highlighting, and animations.
*   `images/`: Placeholder directory for image assets (mockups, logos, icons, backgrounds). You will need to add your actual images here and update the paths in `index.html` and `css/style.css`.
